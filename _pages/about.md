I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Second Language Acquisition and Teaching at the University of Arizona, where I also work as the Graduate Assistant Director of the International Foundations Writing (IFW) Program. I study how a social theory of genre and multilingualism-as-resource approaches enhance student writers' learning experience, and how writing in the academic context is practiced and taught in the digital age. My research revolves around genre studies, multimodal composition, and multilingual writing. At its core, my work aims to prepare students from diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds to become flexible and effective writers through synergistically employing language, genre-related and multimodal resources. I’m proficient in conducting interviews, questionnaires, surveys, participant observations, and analyzing data through qualitative coding and discourse thematic analysis; I’m trained in R for quantitative analysis. My work has appeared in the Journal of Second Language Writing, Computers and Composition, and Language Teaching.
