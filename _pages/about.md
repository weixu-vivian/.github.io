I am an experienced ESL (English as a Second Language) educator with nearly eight years' teaching experience and qualitative researcher (PhDing) with main interests lying in Multilingual Writing, Genre Studies, and Multimodal Composition. At its core, my work aims to prepare multilingual students from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds to succeed in writing both across genres and across languages through synergistically employing language, genre-related and multimodal resources. I’m proficient in conducting interviews, questionnaires, surveys, participant observations, and analyzing data through qualitative coding and discourse thematic analysis; I’m trained in R for quantitative analysis. 

As a current instructor of foundations writing courses at UofA, I specialize in designing and implementing needs analysis in classrooms. My teaching and research experience enriched my understanding of how students’ needs could be collected, analyzed, conceptualized, and addressed. I’m recently working on how to transfer my skills to conducting UX studies to identify opportunities, define problems, and understand user needs and expectations. 

My most recent project looks into how multilingual writers' genre knowledge can be transferred across languages and how their genre knowledge develops through a bilingual genre rewrite task. My another recent project collaborated with my colleague seeks to answer how "citing" is practiced and achieved in video articles for academic purposes.
